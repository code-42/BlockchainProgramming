# **From “What is Blockchain?” to building a blockchain in less than an hour**
  [fcc Blockchain Tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/from-what-is-blockchain-to-building-a-blockchain-within-an-hour-4e738efc819d)

This is my first Blockchain tutorial started December 26, 2017

To complete this tutorial, I first read through it from beginning to end.  Then after understanding what it is all about, I installed the necessary programs on my Mac, but I quickly learned there's more to it than what is indicated in the tutorial.

First I installed Homebrew for Mac, then installed ethereum.  I still don't know exactly what got installed there.  Then I installed Geth, the Go implementation CLI for connecting to my local private blockchain.

The tutorial then led me on to making a genesis block and a json file with instructions for creating the blockchain, which I would then use to learn about a blockchain, and mining, and creating blockchain programs called contracts.

Well, after running the instructions for creating a local Blockchain, it just kept downloading gigabytes of files approximately 2MB each.  I eventually had to ^C that process because my hard drive was filling up fast.

So at this point in the tutorial, I stopped downloading my own private local blockchain and started exploring Solidity and Solc, the Solidity compiler.

But before I got into Solidity, I found this online markdown editor at stackedit.io and started writing this README.md

And this is as far as I got with this tutorial today.
